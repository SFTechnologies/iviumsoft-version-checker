# Next.js Application - IviumSoft Version Checker

This is a simple Next.js application that checks for the latest version of IviumSoft from the official website and compares it with the version currently used by the Pyvium library. If Pyvium is using an outdated version, it notifies via Slack and displays an alert in the application.
